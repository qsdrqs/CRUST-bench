Reminder for Repairing Rust Code:
I need you to repair the provided Rust files, with the following instructions that you MUST follow:

 - The transpiled Rust code MUST NOT contain Foreign Function Interface calls, such as the libc library.

Please think step-by-step and return your final solution for each transpiled file in the following format:
